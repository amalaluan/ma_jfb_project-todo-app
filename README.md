# Project Todo App

A simple Todo List app built with Android Studio and Firebase Firestore for backend. This app provides basic CRUD functionality and consists of three fragments: Todo List, Completed, and Deleted. It does not require authentication and is intended for a single user.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- Firebase Firestore setup in your Firebase project

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   - You can either:
     - Download the ZIP file of the repository.
     - Clone the repository using Git: 
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Project-Todo-App.git
       ```
     - Fork the repository and clone your fork.

2. **Open the project in Android Studio:**
   - Launch Android Studio.
   - Click on "Open an existing project" and navigate to the folder where you cloned or downloaded the project.
   - Select the project directory and click "OK."

## Setting up the Emulator

1. In Android Studio, navigate to the **Device Manager**:
   - Go to the **Tools** menu and select **Device Manager**.
   
2. **Add a new device:**
   - Click on **Create Device**.
   - Choose a **Medium Device**.
   - Click **Next** and then **Finish** to set up the device.

## Running the App

1. After setting up the emulator, click on the **Run** button (green triangle) in Android Studio.
2. The app should launch on the selected device/emulator.

   **Important:** Make sure that the importing process is completed before running the app. You can verify this by checking the bottom right of the screen in Android Studio, where you'll see a progress bar with the word "Importing" as it completes the necessary dependencies and setup.


## Exporting as APK

To export the app as an APK file, follow these steps:

1. In Android Studio, go to the **Build** menu at the top of the window.
2. Select **Generate App Bundle(s) / APK(s)**, and then choose **Generate APK(s)**.
3. Wait for the build process to complete. Once done, a notification will appear at the bottom right of Android Studio with a link to the APK location.
4. Click on the **locate** link in the notification to open the folder where the APK is saved.

Now you have your APK ready to be installed on any Android device!
